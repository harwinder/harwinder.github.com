Hi! I'm a technology enthsiast living in Chandigarh, India. I work for [uTrade Solutions][utrade], which is a growth-stage company I co-founded with a couple of friends in July 2011. When I'm not working, I like to spend time with my family which includes Shivdeep (wife) and Anhad (son).

I have interests in programming, free/open source software, calligraphy and photography.

Here are some of my "social" accounts:
