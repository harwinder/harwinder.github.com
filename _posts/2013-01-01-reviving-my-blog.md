I have trying to write a blog since a long time now. It is just that I could never get started. And, when I started a couple of times, I just did not get used to blogger/wordpress like softwares. And, then I discovered [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "Jekyll").

Jekyll is the blogging platform for hackers. I tried Octopress as well, but I just could not get it to work, as it requires a recent version of Ruby (and yes, rvenv did not work for me).

With Jekyll:

  *  I can write code in Emacs (or vi).
  *  since these are plain text files, I can store my blog in a git/mercurial/svn repository.
  *  I can write blog in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
  *  serve my blog for free with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com)
  *  serve static files instead of messing with a database.
  *  handcraft your HTML pages.
  *  fork an [existing blog](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites) on github.
